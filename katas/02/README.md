# Add some engines

When the up arrow is held down, draw a single engine firing at the rear of the ship.

Once you have that done, try making two engines fire at the rear of the ship.

## Examples

## Hints

1. Use `assets/propulsion.png`
2. To calculate points on a circle:
  * `x = cx + r * cos(a)`
  * `y = cy + r * sin(a)`
    * cx and cy mark the starting point
    * r is the radius
    * a is the angle in radians
